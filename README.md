grails-mount-plugin
===================

allows grails plugins to be mounted to any grails application without restarting.  A subset of grails features will be 
supported and is meant to make a content editor's life easier.  This is not a CMS.  Mountable plugins will be accessed 
directly in a users favorite text editor / IDE and no web editors are provided.  That said, one could build a web editor
around this plugin, or simply use it along with a VCS as a poor man's CMS.
